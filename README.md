[PostCSS] plugin to generate will-change for transition props.

This plugin adds `will-change` property after `transition` property to speed up animations.

Can be combined with [postcss-will-change](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-will-change) plugin.



```css
.foo {
    transition: opacity 0.2s ease, width 0.2s ease;
}
```

```css
.foo {
    transition: opacity 0.2s ease, width 0.2s ease;
    will-change: opacity, width;
}
```
